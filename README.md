# Vididoo

Vididoo is a minimalist media-toolbox that spotlights common editing tasks (cutting, cropping, watermarking, resizing, etc.) and gives each of them a dedicated entry point. The landing grid is intentionally lightweight so editors can jump straight into the workflow they need without wading through menus.

## Highlights
- Curated shortcuts for the most frequent media edits: cut, crop, compress, merge, speed control, audio extraction/replacement, and more.
- Crisp, responsive UI built with Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui components for fast navigation across devices.
- Friendly iconography and hover cues so users can scan every method at a glance and pick the right tool immediately.
- Thoughtful defaults (fonts, gradients, spacing) that keep the focus on the work rather than the interface.
